# Machine Learning of PDEs
This repository contains the code of my Master thesis with the title "Physics Informed Machine Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations".

All results of this work can be recreated by running the files in the *scripts* folder. Note that for some of those you will need the exact solution of the Burgers' equation at a certain granularity. Check out the *burgers_exact* folder for more information on how to generate those.
